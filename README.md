# IdeaBox


IdeaBox is a mod1 partner project. The objectives: create two inputs for name and description of ideas, things to remember, etc. 
The ideas must remain on the page on refresh via local storage. I forked the repo and now individually must refactor and tighten 
up any loose ends as prework for mod2.
